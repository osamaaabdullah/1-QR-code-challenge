## My process
When starting the project, I started designing the project for the web-layout first. My thought process was to use to use flexbox for responsiveness. I soon realized the problem on starting with a web-layout first, and had to restart the challenge starting with the mobile design first. For responsiveness, I used max-width and max-height for the containers and for the qr code image as well.

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
The important takeaway for me was to start from the mobile-layout first to deal with responsiveness.
